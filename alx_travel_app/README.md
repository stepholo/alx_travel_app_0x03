# API Development for Listings and Bookings in Django

## Objective

- Build API views to manage listings and bookings, and ensure the endpoints are documented with Swagger.

## Instructions

1. Duplicate Project:
    - Duplicate the project alx_travel_app_0x00 to alx_travel_app_0x01
2. Create ViewSets:
    - In listings/views.py, create viewsets for Listing and Booking using Django REST frameworkâ€™s ModelViewSet.
    - Ensure that these views provide CRUD operations for both models.
3. Configure URLs:
    - Use a router to configure URLs for the API endpoints.
    - Ensure endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are accessible under /api/.
4. Test Endpoints:
    - Test each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.
